# Jeni's Ice Cream Base

What is the enemy of a great ice cream base? According to Jeni’s Ice Cream, it’s water!

Too much water makes an ice cream base icy and crunchy—not the desired texture—creamy and smooth.

Why? Because if water is not bound to other ingredients in an ice cream base, it turns into crunchy shards of ice. And those ice shards not only ruin the desired creamy mouth-feel, they dilute flavor as well.

Jeni’s addresses this problem by reducing water in its base in several ways:

* Their base recipe includes cornstarch which absorbs water and acts as a thickener.
* Their recipe uses heat to evaporate water from the milk.
* That heat also loosens milk proteins. Then loose milk proteins bind with water to prevent ice from forming.
* Also worth noting: there’s one flavor surprise in Jeni’s ice cream base recipe: three tablespoons of cream cheese!

Why cream cheese? It’s a hint of tart to balance the sugar, plus an extra hit of fat to keep the base rich, decadent, and buttery.

### Makes
Makes approximately 1 litre

### Ingredients
* 450ml whole milk
* 300ml double cream
* 150g sugar
* 1 tbsp. plus 1 tsp. cornstarch
* 3 tbsp. cream cheese, softened
* 1/8 tsp. fine sea salt
* 2 tbsp. light corn syrup


### Instruction
1. Mix about 2 tablespoons of milk with the cornstarch to create a smooth slurry. Then set aside.
2. Whisk cream cheese with salt until smooth.
3. In large saucepan, whisk together the remaining milk, and the cream, sugar, and corn syrup. Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually whisk in cornstarch slurry. Return to a boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Gradually whisk the hot milk mix into the cream cheese until smooth.
5. Pour mixture into a 1-gallon plastic freezer bag; seal and submerge in an ice bath until chilled.
6. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker; process as you usually would with your particular ice cream maker.
7. Pack ice cream in storage container. Top with a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, sealing with air tight lid. Freeze until firm, at least four hours.
