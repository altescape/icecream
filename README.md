## What is an ice cream base?

The base is that mixture of ingredients–usually milk, cream, sugar, and some thickener. 

An ice cream base has a neutral flavor and, hopefully, if it’s executed correctly, a rich, creamy, smooth, dense but soft enough to scoop texture.

The flavorings and mix-ins are separate from the plain base. 

## A Basic Base

Every ice cream base will include some combination of the following necessary ingredients:

* **Milk:** For the premium ice cream we are contemplating, most premium brands use whole milk to create their base. Some advocate using grass-fed whole milk for a more buttery or savory flavor.
* **Cream:** Most brands use heavy whipping cream in order to achieve a certain butterfat percentage in their base. In the USA, to be considered ice cream, a base must have at least 10% butterfat. Any less butterfat and the “ice cream” must instead be called “frozen dairy dessert.”
* **Sugar:** Generally, white sugar is used. However, some brands recommend using a variety of different sugars to create a unique sweet flavor, and a softer, more “scoopable” texture–think brown sugar, corn syrup, tapioca syrup, glucose, honey, even Lyle’s Golden Syrup.
* **Thickener:** Often, for texture, egg yolks are used to create a custard base. But eggs require tempering for pasteurization–an added, time-consuming step. Instead, many premium brands now thicken and stabilize their bases using cornstarch, xanthan gum, glucose, milk powder, or corn syrup–with delicious results.
