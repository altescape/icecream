# Häagen-Dazs Ice Cream Base

What Häagen-Dazs does differently to make its ice cream base so extraordinary:

Egg yolks: lots of them. Six! Some helpful commenters responding to the above video suggest reducing this to four yolks for a better result. The yolks thicken the base, adding structure and texture. The protein in the eggs also binds to water to prevent ice from forming, keeping the base smooth and creamy.

Double cream: this kicks up the butterfat percentage in the base a bit, making the base rich and buttery.

Heating the base: twice! First, a long simmer of 30 minutes. Then, a second heating to 80°C, to pasteurize the eggs. The heat also loosens milk and egg proteins, which bind to water. This keeps the base creamy, preventing ice shards from forming.
