# Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Base

Ben & Jerry’s base recipe includes eggs. This helps make the base creamy, acts as a thickener, and when cooked, adds a hint of custard flavor.

Incorporating protein—here eggs—helps reduce moisture in the base. This happens because water in the base binds with the egg protein. And water that is bound to protein resists turning into ice, keeping the base creamy and smooth.

You’ll notice Ben & Jerry's base also includes slightly more cream and sugar than many other base recipes. This makes Ben & Jerry's base denser, creamier, richer, and sweeter than the typical base.

Ben & Jerry's recipe assumes that you have pasteurised eggs. If not, an alternative recipe is also provided for those using unpasteurised eggs.
